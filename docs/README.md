# localForage Docs

localForage is a handy JavaScript library that improves the offline experience
of your web app by using asynchronous storage (via IndexedDB or WebSQL where
available) but with a simple, `localStorage`-like API.

This is the built version of the
[localForage docs](http://mozilla.github.io/localForage). You can browse the
code in the [master branch](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage).
