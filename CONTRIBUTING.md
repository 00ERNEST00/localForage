# Contributing to localForage #

First off: thanks! Open source software (and thus all software) exists because
of people like you. <3

If you'd like to contribute to localForage, it's as simple as opening a pull
request on GitHub. After that someone will code review your work and either
ask you to fix any errors or merge the code into master. Here are a few tips:

* **do your work on a feature branch**: this keeps things clean and easy
* **try to rebase master into your branch**: this keeps the commit history clean and avoids merge commits inside feature branches
* **write tests**: if you're adding new features, _please_ write tests; likewise, if you're fixing a bug that wasn't previously caught by a test, please add one
* **run `make` before you commit**: this will build out the files in the `dist/` folder and ensure your tests pass

If you have any questions, need some help, or anything else, don't feel shy!
